# CENG 3507 
This is the sharing repo for CENG 3507 Web Development and Programming course offered in MSKU [Department of Computer Engineering](http://bilmuh.mu.edu.tr/).

Usage:

* Install git.
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pembeci/ceng3507.git`
* For your experiments create a branch and switch to it: `git checkout -b hobara`
* Later you can delete the branch with: `git branch -d hobara`
* To get the latest files: `git checkout -b master` (switch to master branch) and then `git pull`
* Instead of cloning and creating branches, you may also fork this repo with your github account and then work on your local copy. You need to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) after I added new files.
